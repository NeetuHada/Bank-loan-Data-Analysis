Personal Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard
Overview
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of personal bank loan approval data. It breaks down loan approvals by various demographic and financial factors, including employment status, income, area, gender, and credit score. The visualizations are designed to help stakeholders understand trends in loan approvals, applicant characteristics, and the key factors influencing loan decisions.

Key Insights:
Loan Approval by Employment Status:

A total of 616 applicants are considered in the analysis.
Self-employed applicants make up only 17.1% of total loan approvals, with the majority of approvals going to non-self-employed individuals (82.9%).
Loan Approvals by Area and Marital Status:

The applicants are categorized based on whether they are from semiurban, urban, or rural areas.
Urban areas show the highest loan approvals, particularly for married individuals.
The semiurban and rural areas have lower numbers of applicants, but the approval rates are still significant for married individuals.
Applicant Income vs. Loan Amount:

A visual breakdown of the correlation between applicant income and the loan amount requested.
Higher loan amounts tend to be requested by applicants with lower incomes, indicating a potential reliance on loans for larger financial needs.
Loan Approvals by Gender:

A majority of loan approvals go to male applicants, with 484 approvals.
Female applicants received 118 approvals, and a small number (12 approvals) were attributed to applicants classified as Other.
Loan Approval by Credit Score:

Loan approval is significantly influenced by credit score, with 422 loans approved for applicants with a positive credit history and 192 loans denied for applicants with lower credit scores.
